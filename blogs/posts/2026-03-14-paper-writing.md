**TL;DR** Research writing is not only about papers. It starts with developing a palate for important problems, then explaining ideas clearly. During a PhD it also requires a practical publishing strategy, and eventually a thesis that connects the larger story of your work.

*Disclaimer:* I do not claim to be an expert in writing papers or finding good research problems. These are things I wish I had read before/during PhD. I am working on them, thinking about them, and trying to hone the craft. What follows are lessons from my own experience, along with ideas from others that I have tried to synthesise and put into practice.

### Choosing problems

Great research starts with choosing the right problems. Before thinking about papers or theses it is worth asking a simpler question: *what problems are actually worth working on?* The goal isn't (well... shouldn't be) publishing papers. The goal is discovering something new and communicating it clearly. A conference paper is just the container. In a PhD this can be conflated, but a well known starting point is: [*What is the most important problem in my field, and why am I not working on it?*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P5k3PGzebd5yYrYqd/the-hamming-question) - Richard Hamming


**A palate for problems.** Some researchers publish a lot with little impact, while others publish fewer papers that shape the field. The difference is often their palate for problems. Ilya Sutskever, for example, has multiple “test of time” papers. Truly great researchers seem able to taste the important problems in one area and then able move to a new area when that becomes more important. So how do we develop this taste?

- **Read widely.** Reading tells you what is currently possible, what people are trying, and where the gaps might be. When a paper is close to your work, read it carefully. What assumptions does it make? What problem does it actually solve? What did the authors not try? What did they leave unexplored? Extract what is useful and move on.

- **Practice, do not wait for divine intervention.** Of course, finding these problems is not easy. Sitting around waiting for a perfect idea rarely works. You develop your taste by practicing the craft. Try ideas. Run experiments. Explore directions. Chat to people. Pitch your ideas. Momentum can help more than raw inspiration.

- **Collaborate with others.** Science is rarely done in a vacuum. Good collaborators catch mistakes, challenge ideas, and push work further. Reaching out can be surprisingly simple if you are thoughtful. Show that you have done some work and that you respect the other person’s contribution. If you bring progress or a concrete question, many researchers are happy to engage.

- **Your unique advantage.** Every researcher has something they do well. Some are strong theoreticians. Others excel at systems, experiments, or data. Some are good at importing ideas from neighbouring fields and making them useful in a new context. The most productive direction is often where an important problem meets something you uniquely do well.

- **Luck is real, but you can harness it.** Timing matters. The community may or may not be ready. You may simply stumble upon a promising direction. Luck plays a role in almost every research story. But recognising when something important appears in front of you is a skill that can be developed.

Once you have a promising problem, the next challenge is communicating the idea clearly.

### What makes a great paper?

Definitely recommend diving into [How to win a best paper award](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2026/how-to-win-a-best-paper-award.html) by Nicholas Carlini. A great paper is not just good research. It is good research explained clearly.

- **One Contribution.** A strong paper revolves around one clear contribution. *What is that single idea that was not obvious before?* Your job is to argue that it is important, novel and supported by rigorous experiments. Avoid the laundry list of “we do X, then Y, then Z”. A good paper feels like a story. Every design choice should be motivated. *Why this method? What are the alternatives? What has been tried before?* You are not just describing what you did. You are teaching your reader why it makes sense.

- **The introduction does the heavy lifting.** The introduction is something people actually read, so this is where you explain why your paper matters. Think of an hourglass. Start broad with something the community already agrees is important, then narrow towards the gap your work addresses. Explain how previous work approached the problem and what is still missing. Build the *moat* around why the problem is hard and why it has not yet been solved. Only then introduce your idea. By the time the reader reaches your method, it should feel almost inevitable. State your contributions clearly at the end.

- **Great papers don't have sloppy experiments.** As a scientist we have a responsibility to do our due diligence in experimentation. Run multiple trials. State hypotheses. Statistical tests. Control for confounders. Perform the obvious ablations. Ask the skeptical questions a reviewer would ask and answer them before they appear. Spending extra time here makes the difference between a weak paper and a rigourous one.

- **A conclusion gives meaning.** A conclusion should not repeat the abstract or introduction in past tense. Instead, step back and explain what the results mean. What should the reader take away from the work? What new possibilities does it open? One useful trick is to imagine the best possible conclusion before starting the project. If you cannot write a compelling ending, the idea may not be strong enough yet.

- **Abstract and titles.** These should be written last. The abstract has two jobs: explain the paper in a few sentences and convince someone it is worth reading. A simple structure works well: topic, problem, method, results, and why it matters. If someone only reads the abstract, they should still understand the core contribution. The title matters less (hot take). Ideally it is almost a one-phrase abstract. But after the catchy and impactful "*Attention is all you need*" and all the named method papers "*Glorcazor: A new model that gets more bolded numbers than before!*". People think all you need is a catchy title. We dont need a clickbait name for everything. A clever/quirky title cannot save a weak paper.

- **Write for a specific reader.** Most papers are read quickly by busy and slightly skeptical people. Imagine a particular reader in your field and write for them. What do they need to know to understand your idea? What objections might they raise? Writing with a reader in mind often makes a paper clearer and easier to follow.

- **Figures should stand alone.** Many readers skim papers and look at the figures first. A good figure should be understandable without reading the surrounding text. Use clear labels, readable fonts and colour-blind friendly palettes. The caption should explain the takeaway: what the figure shows and why it matters. If you cannot explain the message of the figure in one sentence, it is probably too complicated.

- **Conference paper style.** Writing conference papers is a skill you need to learn deliberately. Papers have a certain “look”, a flow, a structure, a language, a density of citations and a style of figures that the community expects. Andrej Karpathy joked about this in his [PhD survival guide blog](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/): a typical ML paper has a one-page introduction, a polished pull figure, a technical section with some maths, bold numbers in tables, one cute extra experiment, a dense related work section, and exactly the page limit with not a line to spare. It's funny because it's true! Understanding the format and style is not cheating. It is learning the game.

Of course, writing good papers is only part of the story. During a PhD you also need a strategy for how to publish them.

### Publishing Strategy

**Build a safety net 🪳 then shoot for the stars 🚀**. During a PhD, aiming for a spectacular 8/10 research paper sounds great in theory but can be risky early on. I recommend starting with the *Cockroach Paper* strategy, suggested by [Yannic Kilchner’s PhD survival guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHQPBqMULXo). The idea is simple: secure enough solid papers to graduate, and then use that safety net to explore bigger moonshot ideas.

**The Roach paper.** These papers are gaps in research that are a bit more incremental. Good for learning the ropes. A roach paper is hard to kill by reviewer and tends to get consistent scores 5s and 6s. It is solid work with careful ablations and no overclaiming. Reviewers are often incentivised to find reasons to reject, so don't make it easy for them. Make sure your claims are precise and backed by evidence. A useful trick is to read papers in your niche and, if possible, read their reviews. Notice what reviewers praise and what they criticise. Different venues have slightly different expectations, so learn to *chameleon* your roach paper accordingly. Put extra analysis and anticipated objections in the appendix.

An ideal process is to set internal deadlines (this rarely happens) and let your group review your draft as if it were a conference submission. Then you submit… aaand you will likely be rejected. This is normal. Listen to reasonable feedback, make the obvious fixes, ignore the noise, and **resubmit**.

It's not worth waiting for perfection. Research is a competitive game, machine learning moves fast, and there is always some luck involved. Your job is to remove avoidable weaknesses and keep moving.

Now that you have a few papers supporting you 🪳, its time to take-some-time and think about the starship big ideas. What ideas will stand the test of time? If they work you're famous! If not, who knows, you might miss and get to the moon? 🚀

    <figcaption style="font-size: 13px; color: gray; margin-top: 6px;">Build a safety net of roach papers, then launch the rocket of moonshot ideas.</figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

That's the ideal. Ironically, I did it in reverse. My supervisor and I spent two years publishing the [moonshot idea](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6QkjC_cs03X), and only afterwards did I start roaching the rest 🪳.

### Thesis writing

A thesis should not just be a collection of your papers (ideally). My supervisor described it as a single-author document that should transcend them. It should tell the story of your research and the themes that connect your work. It should not read like the ending of the work, but the beginning of what comes next. What questions are still important? What ideas matured over time? Think about how it will read in ten years.

For mine I optimised for a lazy reader. I used short chapter summaries and links to make it easier to skim, and kept a consistent visual theme across figures and plots so the whole document felt intentional. (Check it out [here](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/dad86ab3-09eb-48bf-b6d4-8c3d903eb94d)). The best thesis should feel like a coherent story, not something stitched together.

Thesis writing is stressful, but the principle is simple. Decide on the structure early and start writing. Then keep writing. It is easier to edit than to begin. There will always be another experiment you could run. At some point you must draw the line.

### Conclusion

Good research is cooked with taste and served as a story. Develop a palate for the problems that matter. Turn the best of those problems into one clear contribution, polish the experiments, learn the conventions, and use roach papers to buy yourself time for moonshot ideas. Good luck!
